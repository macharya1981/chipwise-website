                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-8">Published: Aug 14, 2025</p>

                <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
                    The journey of a semiconductor from a raw material to the "brain" of a modern electronic device is a marvel of engineering. At ChipWise, we believe understanding this journey is a fundamental step for anyone aspiring to work in the industry. This article provides a high-level overview of the major steps involved in semiconductor manufacturing.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-800 mt-8 mb-4">From Sand to Silicon Wafer</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    It all begins with one of the most abundant elements on Earth: silicon, which is derived from sand. The silicon is purified to an ultra-high degree (99.9999999% purity) and then melted and cooled to form a large, cylindrical crystal called an ingot. This ingot is then sliced into thin, circular discs known as **silicon wafers**. These wafers are the foundation upon which every integrated circuit (IC) is built.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-800 mt-8 mb-4">The Fabrication Process (Frontend)</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    The fabrication, or "fab," process is where the real magic happens. This is an incredibly complex series of steps that takes place in a highly controlled, sterile environment called a **cleanroom**. Key stages include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Oxidation:</strong> A thin layer of silicon dioxide is grown on the wafer's surface, acting as an insulator.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Photolithography:</strong> This is the process of using light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask onto the surface of the wafer. It's similar to taking a picture, but on a microscopic scale.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Etching:</strong> Unwanted material is removed from the wafer, creating the precise patterns defined by the lithography step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Deposition:</strong> New material, such as conductive metals or insulators, is added to the wafer's surface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ion Implantation:</strong> This process "dopes" the silicon with impurities to change its electrical properties, forming the transistors and other components of the circuit.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-800 mt-8 mb-4">Assembly, Test, and Packaging (Backend)</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    After the frontend fabrication is complete, the wafers are sent to the backend. This is where individual chips are cut from the wafer, tested for defects, and packaged into a form that can be used in electronic devices.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wafer Sort:</strong> Each chip (or "die") on the wafer is tested to ensure it functions correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Dicing:</strong> The wafer is cut into individual dies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Packaging:</strong> The functional dies are placed in a protective case with pins or solder balls that allow them to be connected to a circuit board.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Final Test:</strong> The packaged chips undergo a final, rigorous test to ensure they meet all specifications.
                    </li>
                </ul>
